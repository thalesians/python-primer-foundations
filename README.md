# Python primer - foundations

This primer is used to teach Python to students with little or no Python and,
more generally, programming experience.

Typically, the notebooks "without-solutions" are distributed to the students,
whereas the instructor holds on to the notebooks "with-solutions". Exercises
are approached incrementally, in class, and then the students' solutions are
compared with those offered by the instructor.

The order of lecture delivery is as follows:

* The fundamentals of the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks
* Python libraries for working with data
* Visualisation
